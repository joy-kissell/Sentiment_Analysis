Donald Trump Sentiment Analysis Through Tweets

I pulled tweets from X that included the keywords relating to Donald Trump, including "Donald Trump" and "Trump". 
The goal is to analyze Twitter users' overall sentiment towards incoming president Donald Trump, by using VADER. 
One confounding variable is that Donald Trump no longer uses X but instead uses his own platform Truth Social, so there is a missing chunk of users that could be "tweeting" about him not included in this analysis.
